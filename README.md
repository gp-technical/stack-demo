# stack-demo
Get started with the GP stack using this introductory demo application

## What is the `stack`?
The `stack` consists of two packages that together allow you to quickly build single page applications using the REACT and REDUX technologies. They exist to take away much of the boilerplate and leave you with more time to create innovative and useful applications.  These packages are:

* [stack-redux-app](https://github.com/gp-technical/stack-redux-app)
* [stack-redux-api](https://github.com/gp-technical/stack-redux-api)

The `stack` is deliberately opinionated. This means there _is_ a right way to do things and the packages have been designed to work best if they are used in the right way. This demo has been written to give you concrete examples of the right way to use the packages. It is a reference demo, it does not in particular, but what it does do has been selected to provide a graduated introduction to the ways of the `stack`.
